# parallel_linear_equations_solving
#C #MPI #OpenMP

I had to develop three different implementations of Jacobi method which is an iterative algorithm for determining the solutions of a strictly diagonally dominant system of linear equations, using:
(1) non-parallelization approach (sequential)
(2) parallelization with OpenMP
(3) parallelization with MPI

Purpose: 
Project was made for Distributed and Parallel Computations course within Computer Science studies in @2017
